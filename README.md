- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BraveNewDeFi

I am the head of Communications for [Nexus Mutual](https://twitter.com/NexusMutual), and I have a background in technical writing among other genres of writing. I work to keep DeFi users safe through education and by creating greater awareness of smart contract and full-stack risk in DeFi. The best way to hedge against smart contract and technical risk is by using Nexus Mutual's cover policies to keep your productive assets secure.
