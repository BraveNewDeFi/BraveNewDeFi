- 👋 Hi, I’m @BraveNewDeFi
- 👀 I’m interested in writing technical documentation for DeFi protocols.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Solidity and expanding my knowledge of all things DeFi on Ethereum.
- 💞️ I’m open to working with any protocol that could use my technical writing expertise to better build out their GitBook docs.
- 📫 You can email me at bcostas99782@gmail.com, connect with me on Discord (BraveNewDeFi#0027) or Twitter (@BraveDeFi).
